          I was born in Carlos Tejedor, a small town located in the northwest of Buenos Aires, 500km. away from C.A.B.A,
          where I moved after finishing Highschool. <br />
          Although I earned my bachelor≈õ degree as an Industrial Designer (UBA), i am currently pursuing a career as a developer <br />
          I am inherently curious, that's why i believe everything we encounter embodies a learning experience and that there is always
          room for self-improvement. It was my curiosity tht led me to live in the United States (N.Y) and South Korea (Seoul)
          where I worked and studied respectively. <br />
          Through these multicultural experiences I improved my ability to adapt to different environments and heterogeneous work groups
          and, most importantly, i gained a new perspective of the world we are inmersed in.
